# Java DSA Coding Patterns Repository

This repository contains 16 essential coding patterns for solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems in Java, designed to help you excel in coding interviews. Each pattern is a reusable technique combining data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies to tackle specific types of problems efficiently. This resource is inspired by [Chanda-Abdul's JavaScript-based coding patterns repository](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews) but adapted for Java.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide Java developers with a structured guide to recognize and apply these patterns when solving DSA problems. Each pattern is documented in a separate markdown file with a description, use cases, approach, example problem, and a Java implementation.

## Coding Patterns
Below is a list of the 16 coding patterns included in this repository, with links to their respective markdown files for detailed explanations and Java code examples.

2. [✅ Pattern_2 - Two Pointers](✅ Pattern_2 - Two Pointers.markdown) - Efficiently handle sorted arrays or linked lists.
3. [✅ Pattern_3 - Fast & Slow Pointers](✅ Pattern_3 - Fast Slow Pointers.markdown) - Detect cycles or find midpoints in linked lists.
4. [✅ Pattern_4 - Merge Intervals](✅ Pattern_4 - Merge Intervals.markdown) - Handle overlapping intervals.
5. [✅ Pattern_5 - Cyclic Sort](✅ Pattern_5 - Cyclic Sort.markdown) - Sort arrays with numbers in a specific range.

8. [✅ Pattern_8 - Tree Depth-First Search (DFS)](✅ Pattern_8 - Tree DFS.markdown) - Explore paths deeply in trees.
9. [✅ Pattern_9 - Two Heaps](✅ Pattern_9 - Two Heaps.markdown) - Maintain balanced data for medians or scheduling.
10. [✅ Pattern_10 - Subsets](✅ Pattern_10 - Subsets.markdown) - Generate all possible subsets or permutations.
11. [✅ Pattern_11 - Modified Binary Search](✅ Pattern_11 - Modified Binary Search.markdown) - Search in sorted arrays with variations.

13. [✅ Pattern_13 - Top K Elements](✅ Pattern_13 - Top K Elements.markdown) - Find top/smallest/frequent K elements.
14. [✅ Pattern_14 - K-way Merge](✅ Pattern_14 - K way Merge.markdown) - Merge K sorted arrays or lists.
15. [✅ Pattern_15 - Dynamic Programming (DP)](✅ Pattern_15 - Dynamic Programming.markdown) - Solve optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.
16. [✅ Pattern_16 - Topological Sort](✅ Pattern_16 - Topological Sort.markdown) - Order nodes based on dependencies in graphs.
