# 🚀 My DSA Coding Patterns Journey

Welcome to my personal collection of **16 Essential Coding Patterns** for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms! 🎯

## 📚 About This Repository

This is my **personal learning journey** through the most important coding patterns that every software engineer should master. I created this repository to:

- **Deepen my understanding** of DSA concepts through practical implementation
- **Build muscle memory** for recognizing patterns during coding interviews
- **Create a reference guide** for future problem-solving sessions
- **Share knowledge** with fellow developers on the same learning path

Each pattern here represents hours of study, practice, and refinement. I've implemented them in Java because that's my primary language, but the concepts are universal across all programming languages.

## 🎯 Why These Patterns Matter

During my interview preparation, I realized that most DSA problems can be solved using a handful of fundamental patterns. Instead of memorizing hundreds of individual problems, I focused on mastering these **16 core patterns** that can be adapted to solve countless variations.

Think of these patterns as your **coding superpowers** - once you master them, you'll be able to tackle complex problems with confidence! 💪
