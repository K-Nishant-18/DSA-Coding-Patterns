# Java DSA Coding Patterns Repository

This repository contains 16 essential coding patterns for solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems in Java, designed to help you excel in coding interviews. Each pattern is a reusable technique combining data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies to tackle specific types of problems efficiently. This resource is inspired by [Chanda-Abdul’s JavaScript-based coding patterns repository](https://github.com/Chanda-Abdul/Several-Coding-Patterns-for-Solving-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Problems-during-Interviews) but adapted for Java.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide Java developers with a structured guide to recognize and apply these patterns when solving DSA problems. Each pattern is documented in a separate markdown file with a description, use cases, approach, example problem, and a Java implementation.

## Coding Patterns
Below is a list of the 16 coding patterns included in this repository, with links to their respective markdown files for detailed explanations and Java code examples.

1. [Sliding Window](Sliding_Window.md) - Solve problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
2. [Two Pointers](Two_Pointers.md) - Efficiently handle sorted arrays or linked lists.
3. [Fast & Slow Pointers](Fast_Slow_Pointers.md) - Detect cycles or find midpoints in linked lists.
4. [Merge Intervals](Merge_Intervals.md) - Handle overlapping intervals.
5. [Cyclic Sort](Cyclic_Sort.md) - Sort arrays with numbers in a specific range.
6. [In-place Reversal of a LinkedList](Inplace_Reversal_LinkedList.md) - Reverse linked lists or sublists.
7. [Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS)](Tree_BFS.md) - Process tree nodes level by level.
8. [Tree Depth-First Search (DFS)](Tree_DFS.md) - Explore paths deeply in trees.
9. [Two Heaps](Two_Heaps.md) - Maintain balanced data for medians or scheduling.
10. [Subsets](Subsets.md) - Generate all possible subsets or permutations.
11. [Modified Binary Search](Modified_Binary_Search.md) - Search in sorted arrays with variations.
12. [Bitwise XOR](Bitwise_XOR.md) - Solve problems using bitwise operations.
13. [Top K Elements](Top_K_Elements.md) - Find top/smallest/frequent K elements.
14. [K-way Merge](K_way_Merge.md) - Merge K sorted arrays or lists.
15. [Dynamic Programming (DP)](Dynamic_Programming.md) - Solve optimization problems with overlapping subproblems.
16. [Topological Sort](Topological_Sort.md) - Order nodes based on dependencies in graphs.
